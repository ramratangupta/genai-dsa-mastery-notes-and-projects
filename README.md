# AI + DSA Roadmap

A structured 6-week learning plan combining:
- Generative AI engineering (prompting, embeddings, RAG, automation)
- Pattern-based Data Structures & Algorithms
- Daily notes, reflections, and experiments

This repository captures my journey as a developer upgrading into the GenAI era, while strengthening core DSA patterns necessary for interviews.

## 🎯 Objectives

### **1. GenAI Engineering**
- Build strong prompting fundamentals (R.A.C.E., few-shot, constraints)
- Understand model behavior (temperature, top-p, tokens, reasoning depth)
- Work with embeddings, vector search, and small RAG prototypes
- Integrate AI into real-world projects (summaries, extraction, workflows)
- Learn retry logic, limits, and API best practices

### **2. DSA Mastery (Pattern Based)**
Learn the 12 core patterns that solve 90% of interview problems:
- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- Fast/Slow Pointer  
- Hash Maps & Sets  
- Stacks & Monotonic Stack  
- Binary Search  
- DFS (Trees, Graphs)  
- BFS (Shortest Path)  
- Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy  
- Graph Algorithms

## 🔍 Daily Workflow 
1. **Warm-up (10 mins)**  
2. Learn a pattern (30 mins)  
3. Solve 1 problem (40 mins)  
4. Compare patterns (20 mins)  
5. One-line reflection (5 mins)

---

## 🔧 Weekend Workflow (Sat–Sun)
Deep pattern practice  
AI project integration (RAG, extraction, automation)

---

## 🌱 Reflection Philosophy
DSA trains the **mind**.  
AI trains the **future**.  
Together they shape a balanced, confident developer.

Daily reflections go here:  
```
/notes/reflections/
```

---

## 🧪 Experiments
- **temp_vs_top_p** → Test model behavior  
- **embeddings_playground** → Play with vector similarity  

These help build intuition — the most important skill in AI engineering.

---

## ✔ Status
This repo evolves weekly. Each folder grows with:
- notes  
- code  
- prompts  
- experiments  
- reflections  

My goal: **become a balanced developer — strong in DSA, fluent in GenAI, and grounded as a human.**
