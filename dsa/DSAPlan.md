# ✅ **6-Week Pattern-Based DSA Study Plan (Clean & Practical)**

This plan removes chaos and teaches you **DSA the right way — pattern-first**.


# ⭐ WEEK 1 — Arrays, Strings & Sliding Window

Goal: Build intuition for problems based on frequency, windows, pointers.

### Patterns:

* Sliding Window
* Hash Map Frequency
* Two Pointers (simple ones)

### Problems (6 total):

* Longest substring without repeating characters
* Anagram check
* Max sum subarray (size k)
* Move zeros
* Two-sum
* Valid palindrome

### Outcome:

You will understand **when** to use:

* window
* two-pointer
* hashing

---

# ⭐ WEEK 2 — Hash Map + Two Pointers (Advanced)

Goal: Medium-level thinking.

### Patterns:

* Two-pointer on sorted structures
* Prefix sums
* Hash maps with logic
* Set-based logic

### Problems:

* 3-sum
* 4-sum
* Group anagrams
* Subarray sum = k
* Product of array except self

---

# ⭐ WEEK 3 — Trees + DFS + BFS

Goal: Build core intuition for recursive structures.

### Patterns:

* Binary Trees
* DFS
* BFS
* Pre/Post/In-order
* Level order traversal

### Problems:

* Max depth of tree
* Path-sum
* Level order traversal
* Balanced tree check
* Diameter of tree

**Outcome:**
You will understand that **most tree problems = DFS + condition.**

---

# ⭐ WEEK 4 — Graphs + Shortest Path

Goal: Get strong with BFS, adjacency lists, and traversals.

### Patterns:

* BFS
* DFS
* Topological Sort
* Cycle detection

### Problems:

* Number of islands
* Rotten oranges
* Course schedule
* Bipartite graph check
* Shortest path (unweighted graph)

---

# ⭐ WEEK 5 — Dynamic Programming (DP Basics)

Goal: Build DP intuition — not formulas.

### Patterns:

* Recursion → memo → DP
* Tabulation
* Subset problems
* Fibonacci variations

### Problems:

* Climbing stairs
* House robber
* Coin change (min coins)
* Longest common subsequence

---

# ⭐ WEEK 6 — Mixed  Prep

Goal: Fuse patterns.
We will mix:

* array
* tree
* graph
* SQL
* AI-based reasoning
* system design questions (at dev level)

Weekend:

* **Mock 45-min simulation with me**
* **Confidence-boosting practice**
* **Reflection + revision**

# 🌿 How You Study Each Day

### Weekdays

* Warm-up
* Learn pattern
* Solve 1 problem
* Compare pattern with other patterns
* Write 1-line reflection

### Weekends

** Deep practice
** Project integration (LLM + DSA + automation)

---

# 🌸 Final Word

> “DSA requires understanding patterns, and one problem may involve multiple patterns.”

This is EXACTLY how real engineers think.
