# 🌿 My LEARNING STORY for Creating Google Gemini Gems – Custom GPT

I started my [Gitopdesh](https://heartfulness.org/education/gitopadesh-courses/) Train The Trainer — Hindi Batch on **13th September 2025**.

Later, I joined the [AI Mastery Bootcamp for Beginners by Heartfulness Academy](https://heartfulnessacademy.com)(2nd Batch: **7th October to 17th October**).

My Gitopdesh assessment was scheduled for **9th October**.

---

## **1. Beginning the Journey**

For the assessment, each team had to find a story and reflection.
I mixed my AI learning with Gitopdesh using a simple idea:

> “Can AI help me teach children the Gita in a simple, beautiful, Daaji-style way?”

I didn’t know anything about detailed prompts, formatting, or how AI models behave.
I just began with the most basic lines:

* “गीता श्लोक संख्या 3.42 के लिए कहानी बताओ”
* “पंचतंत्र से जोड़कर बच्चों को समझाओ”
* “इमेज बना दो”
* “शब्दार्थ बताओ”

👉 [See my basic prompts](../projects/gita_explainer/Intial_basic_promts_hindi_for_Gita.md)

I didn’t know what would happen — but I started.

---

## **2. The First Attempts**

My early prompts were simple:

* “3.42 की कहानी बताओ”
* “इमेज बना दो”
* “पंचतंत्र जोड़ो”

The results were mixed:

* Sometimes good
* Sometimes wrong
* Sometimes the verse changed
* Sometimes stories were invented
* Sometimes images had strange text

But this was my first lesson:

> “AI gives exactly what we ask — not what we imagine.”

This single understanding changed my entire journey.

📌 *[I even created an awesome PPT using images generated by Google Gemini.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UDMUlRSGZCZHFNK-K_mOWFeVSfNDjqXu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114433674424419894797&rtpof=true&sd=true)*

---

## **Hallucination Learning**

* AI created creative stories that did not exist.
  I then specified: **use only Hitopadesh, Panchatantra, Vedas, Upanishads** → Result improved.

* Daaji is male.
  AI sometimes called him “Didi” or changed his gender → I corrected this in the prompt.

* MCQ generation was initially NOT interactive.

* I attempted to include quotes from all masters. AI did generate them,
  but **could not cite sources** → I removed this entire section.

---

## **3. Discovering Structure**

Very soon, I realized I needed:

* A fixed structure
* Verse consistency
* Authentic stories
* Word meanings
* Pāda breakdown
* Sandhi-viched
* A proper flow

So I began writing longer, structured prompts — like checklists:

✔ पूरा श्लोक
✔ पाद विभाजन
✔ शब्दार्थ
✔ संधि-विच्छेद
✔ कहानी
✔ इमेज
✔ MCQ

Then came the next lesson:

> “Long prompts work only when they are clean, precise, and structured.”

So I refined them again… and again.

---

## **Request for English Version**

* When brothers and sisters saw the Hindi version, they loved it.
* They requested an English version.
* I created an English version.
* I later improved it into a multilingual version.

---

## **4. Learning About MCQs**

MCQs were the hardest problem.

Even with instructions like:

* “Put options on new lines”
* “Use A, B, C, D format”

The model still printed:

“A. B. C. D.” on the **same line**.

I was completely stuck.

Then I learned:

> **LLMs compress lines in non-English languages.**

The solution was:

* Strict MCQ format
* Blank lines
* Self-correction rules
* Mandatory newlines after every option

Suddenly…

### **MCQs became perfect.**

A major breakthrough.

---

## **5. Realizing the Power of Knowledge Bases (KB)**

At one stage I thought:

> “Let me put all of Daaji’s Bhagavad Gita talks into the KB.”
* I created [NoteBookLM by adding 17 reosurces from YouTube and Heartfulness Website](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/321f7362-3935-4312-8097-e84f71f2c3a4)

But I discovered:

* KB with shloka numbers restricts output
* KB with commentary blocks unknown verses
* KB forces the model to say “I don’t know”
* KB creates hallucination if quotes are incomplete

Thus, my biggest realization:

> **For Gitopdesh, the best KB is a *Style KB*, not a *Content KB*.**

So I created:

* ✔ [Daaji Style KB (English)](../projects/gita_explainer/Daaji_Style_KB_English.txt)
* ✔ [Daaji Style KB (Hindi)](../projects/gita_explainer/Daaji_Style_KB_Hindi.txt)

And outputs became:

* Calm
* Simple
* Loving
* Pure
* Heart-centered

Exactly like Daaji.

This was a deep and beautiful learning.

---

## **6. Perfecting the Pāda Table**

Multilingual outputs (Hindi, Telugu, Tamil…) broke the pronunciation lines.

I learned:

* Auto language detection is essential
* The pāda table must always be **3 columns**

| Sanskrit | Detected Language | English |

This solved everything.

---

## **7. Understanding Stories**

Initially, AI invented stories.

I then learned:

* Use only **real stories** — Hitopadesh, Panchatantra, Vedas, Upanishads
* Never allow “newly created” stories
* Always link story → shloka
* Use child-friendly narration
* Use image suggestions

Then my storybook sections became **authentic and beautiful**.

---

## **8. Improving the Flow**

Eventually, I discovered the perfect Gitopdesh structure:

1. Relaxation
2. Prayer
3. Ice-breaker
4. Shloka
5. Pāda table
6. Word meaning
7. Sandhi-viched
8. Story
9. Heartfulness connection
10. Reflection
11. Interactive quiz

Every output became a **PPT-style learning session**.

Beautiful and structured.

---

## **9. Understanding What Not to Do**

Learning what **NOT** to do saved me hours.

* No full talks in KB
* No shloka numbers in KB
* No mixed styles
* No fabricated quotes
* No unnecessary complexity
* No changing the Prayer

---

## **10. Maturity of the System**

By the end:

### **Gitopdesh Engine for Age 5–15**

* [Hindi Version – 1st creation](https://gemini.google.com/gem/11iRAUOkuLceY105VaA0eyh7oYw-OsM0U?usp=sharing)
* [Multilingual – Latest version 3rd creation](https://gemini.google.com/gem/11iRAUOkuLceY105VaA0eyh7oYw-OsM0U?usp=sharing)

### **Gitopdesh Engine for Age 15+**

* [Hindi Version – 2nd creation](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1igIq9Y83NBGwlcPREXn2AVN2O3Djhytg?usp=sharing)
* [Multilingual – Latest version 4th creation](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1RJOU2SSWIfbRHGEbB7BkBr1peSREvzkW?usp=sharing)

And at this stage I had:

✔ Daaji Style KBs
✔ Perfect MCQs
✔ Perfect pāda table
✔ Beautiful storytelling
✔ Gentle Heartfulness linking
✔ Clean multilingual behavior
✔ Stable image generation
✔ Minimal hallucination

This was no longer a “prompt.”
It became:

> **“A complete Gitopdesh Learning System.”**
> **“A gift for children.”**
> **“A tribute to Daaji.”**
> **“A spiritual teaching flow.”**

---

## **11. What This Journey Taught Me**

This journey taught me:

* Clarity creates clarity
* Structure creates beauty
* Precision creates stability
* Simplicity creates purity
* Heart creates flow
* Repetition creates mastery
* Patience creates transformation

But the deepest lesson:

> **“AI is like Krishna’s chariot —
> you must hold the reins with clarity.”**

When I gave clear instructions,
the output became divine.

When I was unclear,
the output became confused.

This is the truth.

## **12. My Message to Anyone Starting**

Start simple.
Experiment.
Fail.
Refine.
Learn.
Trust the process.
Trust your heart.
