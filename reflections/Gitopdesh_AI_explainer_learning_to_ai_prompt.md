# 🌿 My LEARNING STORY for Creating Google Gemini Gems - Custom GPT

I started my [Gitopdesh](https://heartfulness.org/education/gitopadesh-courses/) Train The Trainer - training program Hindi Batch 1st - 13 Sep 2025.

Subsequnlty I also joined [AI Mastery Bootcamp for Beginners by Heartfulness Academy](https://heartfulnessacademy.com/) - 2nd Batch 7th October to 17th October.

I had assesment scheduled for Gitopdesh 9th Oct.
## **1. Beginning the Journey**

For assesment each team need to find story and reflection so I mixed my AI learning and Gitopdesh with a simple idea:

> “Can AI help me teach children the Gita in a simple, beautiful, Daaji-style way?”

I didn’t know anything about detailed prompts, formatting, or AI model behavior.
I just began with the most basic lines:

* “गीता श्लोक संख्या 3.42 के लिए कहानी बताओ”
* “पंचतंत्र से जोड़कर बच्चों को समझाओ”
* “इमेज बना दो”
* “शब्दार्थ बताओ”
* [See my basic promts](../projects/gita_explainer/Intial_basic_promts_hindi_for_Gita.md)

I didn’t know what would happen — but I started.

---

## **2. The First Attempts**

My early prompts were simple:

* “3.42 की कहानी बताओ”
* “इमेज बना दो”
* “पंचतंत्र जोड़ो”

Sometimes the outputs were good.
Sometimes they were wrong.
Sometimes the verse changed.
Sometimes the story was invented.
Sometimes the images had strange text.

But this was the first lesson:

> “AI gives exactly what we ask — not what we imagine.”

This understanding alone changed my journey.

## Hallucihalnation Learning
- Creating creative stories which do not exits, then I asked find from itopadesh, Panchatantra, Vedas, Upanishads, it improved
- Daaji is male, AI some times told him Didi, or changed his gender, I corrected that in prompt.
- MCQ genration was not interactive when I started
- I tried to include qoutes from all masters it did but it was not able to provide sourcec form where it got, I removed that.
---

## **3. Discovering Structure**

Very soon, I realized:

* I needed a fixed structure
* I needed the verse to stay consistent
* I needed authentic stories
* I needed word meaning
* I needed padas
* I needed sandhi-viched
* I needed a flow

So I began writing longer prompts.

They became like checklists:

✔ पूरा श्लोक
✔ पाद विभाजन
✔ शब्दार्थ
✔ संधि-विच्छेद
✔ कहानी
✔ इमेज
✔ MCQ

But then I learned another lesson:

> “Long prompts work only when they are clean, precise, and structured.”

So I refined it again… and again.

## **Request for English Version**
- When brother and sister's found Hindi was awesome they requested english version.
- I created only English
- I updated English version to multilingual.
----
## **4. Learning About MCQs**

MCQs were the hardest part.

Even when I said:

* “Options on new lines”
* “Format like A, B, C, D”

The model still printed:

“A. B. C. D. सब एक ही लाइन में।”

I felt stuck.

But then I learned:

**LLMs compress lines in non-English languages.**
The solution was:

* Strict format
* Blank lines
* Self-correction rules
* Forcing newline after each option

And suddenly…

**MCQs became perfect.**
This was a breakthrough.

## **5. Realizing the Power of Knowledge Bases**

At one stage I thought:

“Let me put all Bhagavad Gita's talk by Daaji into it's knowdlege base (KB).”

But I discovered:

* KB with shloka numbers restricts output
* KB with commentary blocks unknown verses
* KB forces the model to say “I don’t know”
* KB creates hallucihalnation if quotes are incomplete

The biggest realization:

> “For Gitopdesh, the best KB is a *Style KB*, not a *Content KB*.”

So I created:

* [Daaji Style KB (English)](../projects/gita_explainer/Daaji_Style_KB_English.txt)
* [Daaji Style KB (Hindi)](../projects/gita_explainer/Daaji_Style_KB_Hindi.txt)

And the outputs transformed.

They became:

* Calm
* Simple
* Loving
* Pure
* Heart-centered

Just like Daaji.

This was the deepest learning.

## **6. Perfecting the Pāda Table**

When outputs were multilingual (Hindi, Telugu, Tamil…),
the pronunciation broke.

I learned:

* Language detection must be automatic
* Pāda table must always be 3 columns

So the fix was:

| Sanskrit | Detected language | English |

This solved everything.

---

## **7. Understanding Stories**

Initially, AI sometimes invented stories.

So I learned:

* Always ask: *“Real stories only — from Hitopadesh, Panchatantra, Vedas, Upanishads.”*
* Never let it “create new stories”
* Always link back to the shloka
* Always add child-friendly flow
* Always add image suggestions

Now the storybook sections started feeling true.

---

## **8. Improving the Flow**

Gradually, I built a perfect sequence as per Gitopdesh learning flow:

1. Relaxation
2. Prayer
3. Ice-breaker
4. Verse
5. Pāda table
6. Word meaning
7. Sandhi-viched
8. Story
9. Heartfulness connection
10. Reflection
11. Interactive quiz

And every output became a **PPT-style session**.

This was beautiful.

---

## **9. Understanding What Not to Do**

I also learned:

* Not to put all the talks in KB
* Not to include shloka numbers in KB
* Not to mix styles
* Not to ask AI to fabricate quotes
* Not to overload prompts with extra conditions
* Not to change the prayer

Learning what not to do saved me many hours.

## **10. Maturity of the System**

By the end of the journey, I had:

### A full Gitopdesh Engine for Age group 5-15
- [Hindi Version 1st creation](https://gemini.google.com/gem/11iRAUOkuLceY105VaA0eyh7oYw-OsM0U?usp=sharing)

✔ Daaji Style KBs
✔ Perfect MCQs
✔ Perfect pāda table
✔ Beautiful storytelling
✔ Gentle Heartfulness linking
✔ Clean multilingual behaviour
✔ Stable image generation
✔ Less hallucination

This was no longer “just a prompt.”
It became:

> “A Gitopdesh Learning System.”
> “A gift for children.”
> “A tribute to Daaji.”
> “A spiritual teaching flow.”

## **11. What This Journey Taught Me**

This journey taught me:

* Clarity creates clarity
* Structure creates beauty
* Precision creates stability
* Simplicity creates purity
* Heart creates flow
* Repetition creates mastery
* Patience creates transformation

But the biggest lesson:

> “AI is like Krishna’s chariot —
> you must hold the reins with clarity.”

When I gave clear instructions,
the output became divine.

When I was confused,
the output became confused.

This is the deepest truth.

Experiment.
Fail.
Refine.
Learn.
